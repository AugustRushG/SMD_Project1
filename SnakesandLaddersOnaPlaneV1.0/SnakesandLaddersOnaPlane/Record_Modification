Task 1
When the hand got clicked(NavigationPane->buttonClicked), it starts to roll(NavigationPane->roll)
Which creat a die(Die class), runs act in Die class, then call startMoving(NavigationPane->startMoving)
NavigationPane as a controller, contains the method of roll(), which violates the rule of high cohesion,
it would be better to just control the input and the output of the NavigationPane.
So, it would be better to create a new class and let it contains the method of roll, and have the responsibilities of
create dices.
